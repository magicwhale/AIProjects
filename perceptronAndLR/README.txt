This project contains implementations of the perceptron and linear regression algorithms.

To run the perceptron algorithm, run the command:
python3 problem1_3.py input1.csv output1.csv

This takes input from the file input1.csv and outputs weights for a decision boundary
in the file output1.csv

To run the linear regression algorithm, run the command:
python3 problem2_3.py input2.csv output2.csv

This takes input from the file input2.csv and outputs the calcuated weights in a file
called output2.csv, using various learning rates and iterations.
